Repository for my performance testing with k6.

## Quick tutorial

- Clone the repository
- Install required dependencies (npm install)
- Run any script (e.g. "npm run test:base")
- Enjoy

## Tutorial Explanation

- I predefined the scripts, so you can just choose which to run
- To see the scripts see package.json

## Notes
- Keep in mind that I set the VU values specifically low, to not overload the public test API. :)
